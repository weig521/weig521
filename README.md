KAT Manufacturing Tableau Data Analytics 

Tableau is a powerful tool to do data analysis and data visualization. In this project, we use KAT manufacturing (anonymized data and name) to build and format various visualizations, create filters, map chart, interactive dashboards, analyze sales data with the dashboards and more. With the work, we can answer a lot of useful questions like find the top customer in German in year 2019 if we want to develop a new strategy for that or find the worst performing sales region in 2020 if we want to help them catch up. 

Data dictionary
1.	Customer number: An alphanumeric unique number for each customer.
2.	Division: The location of the division making the sale.
3.	Customer location: Location of the customer. Customers may purchase from a division not located in the same geographic location as the customer, due to differences in products sold by each division.
4.	Category: Category of product sold (Govt, R & D and Other; Materials Processing; Medical; and Telecom.)
5.	Market: Target market for this product 
6.	Product line: The product line for this product 
7.	Use: Intended use for this product 
8.	Period ending date: The quarter ending date in which the sale was made.
9.	Sales revenue: The total amount of the sale in US dollars.
10.	Customer name:  The name of each customer.  

I built visualizations of revenue by year, total sales by quarter and year, total revenue by category, sales by product line, top ten customers, sales by division, and sales by division map. Based on the visualizations, I created an interactive dashboard for the better understanding of audience.
